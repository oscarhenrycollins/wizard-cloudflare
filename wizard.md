# Cloudflare

Sign in with Cloudflare once (or create a free account there). The app then shows a small card per account (websites, storage, domains) and nothing else: you ask your Wizard to publish a website, back up a folder from Files, find a domain or change DNS, and it does the work.

- Provides `cloudflare-connection` (contract `wizard.cloudflare-connection/1`) plus the jobs `website-publishing`, `backup-storage` and `domains`; several logins and accounts.
- Every change the Wizard prepares waits for one tap: a "Your Wizard wants to …" card with Approve / Decline in the app (plus a Notifications ping when that app is installed). The Wizard cannot approve its own changes.
- Possible changes: publish a Files folder as a `workers.dev` website, back up a Files folder to R2, create a bucket, upload an object, create or update DNS records, deploy a Worker. Nothing is deleted. Domains can be searched and priced, never bought.
- Opened inside the Wizard shell at `/wizard-cloudflare/`; the owner is the signed-in tailnet user named by Tailscale Serve (`WIZARD_OWNER_LOGINS`), plus exact Host/Origin checks and CSRF on every write. MCP is box-only.
- Files is mounted read-only. Tokens stay in this app's private volume.
